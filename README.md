After so many attempts this user management system is working fine and if you want to try this 
fiel or this repo please aleways open the admin.php file...
admin.php is the main file for our source and


#if you wanna change the database requirements then you can change inside the db.php file.
other changes you can make according to youe convinence.



faltu.php file was just to check the functionality of the functions and methods.
You can delete this if you want...There is no really use of this file.
